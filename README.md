# 04_Projects

This repository contains my personal and experimental software projects.  
It serves as a collection of pet projects, prototypes, and learning applications —  
mostly developed with Go, but also with other languages and tools used for practice and experimentation.

Each subfolder inside this repository represents a separate project with its own structure,  
README file, and Git commit history.

## Projects

- **bookmanager-go**  
  Go-based CRUD web application with Clean Architecture, JWT authentication, Redis caching, and Docker.  

- **2025-12-02 — URL Status & PDF Report Service**  
  Go-based web service that checks URL availability using a worker pool and generates PDF reports.  
  Includes concurrent processing with goroutines and channels, JSON-based storage, and graceful shutdown handling.

**Purpose:**  
To document my learning progress, demonstrate practical implementations, and explore different development patterns.
