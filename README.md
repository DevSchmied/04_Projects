# 04_Projects

This repository contains my personal and experimental software projects.  
It serves as a collection of pet projects, prototypes, and learning applications â€”  
mostly developed with Go, but also with other languages and tools used for practice and experimentation.

Each subfolder inside this repository represents a separate project with its own structure,  
README file, and Git commit history.

ðŸ“š Examples of future contents:
- bookmanager-go
- task-tracker

**Purpose:**  
To document my learning progress, demonstrate practical implementations, and explore different development patterns.
